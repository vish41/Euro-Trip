World Heritage-listed Lord Howe Island is a haven for serenity-seekers and nature lovers. Surrounded by the world's most southerly coral reef, this spectacular island, about 660 kilometers off the New South Wales north coast, only allows a maximum of 400 guests at a time.

Lord Howe encompasses a number of islets, which are part of a former volcano. Dramatic cliffs rise along the rugged coast, and other island highlights include white-sand beaches, pristine native forests of pandanus and kentia palms, and spectacular views from atop 875-meter-high Mt. Gower.
