Chicago, the "Windy City" as it is often called, lies along the shores of Lake Michigan. Known for its vibrant arts scene, numerous cultural attractions, excellent shopping, and interesting architecture, this city attracts visitors from the US and around the globe.

Chicago enjoys a worldwide reputation as a focal point of 20th-century architecture and art, with architects such as Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright, and artists like Picasso, Mir√µ, Dubuffet, and Chagall leaving their mark.

The city also has much to offer in the sporting sphere, too, with the Chicago Bears in American football, the Chicago White Sox and Cubs in baseball, and the Chicago Bulls in basketball.

Last, but not least, are the beautiful beaches that stretch along the waterfront, attracting throngs of sun seekers in the summer.

Deciding when to visit Chicago may depend on your interests, particularly if you are coming for sports or cultural events, but spring until fall is the best time for weather.

Millennium Park is part of the larger Grant Park, located in downtown Chicago bordered by Michigan Avenue to the west, Columbus Drive to the east, Randolph Street to the north, and Monroe Street to the south. Its centerpiece is a 110-ton sculpture name Cloud Gate, which has a polished, mirror-like stainless steel surface that was inspired by liquid mercury. It reflects the surroundings, including buildings, the sky, and the tourists who walk through its central arch.


Another top attraction in Millennium Park is Crown Fountain, a fascinating modern interpretation of the ancient gargoyle that gives the appearance of water flowing from the mouths of projected images of Chicago citizens. Other popular things to do here include seeing a performance at the Jay Pritzker Pavilion, an outdoor concert venue, and visiting Lurie Garden, which is open to the public at no cost year-round.

The Adler Planetarium is leaps and bounds beyond the ones most kids get to visit on school trips, and all ages will appreciate the shows and comprehensive exhibits it has to offer. The Adler prides itself in being the first planetarium in the Western Hemisphere, built in 1930 on the shore of Lake Michigan.

The planetarium is home to two dome theaters, which offer a variety of shows, including exploration of Chicago's night sky, the solar system, and the moon. There is also an extensive array of exhibits that explore topics including life on other worlds, meteors and meteorites, space exploration, the history of the scientific discipline, and even the history of astrology.

There are also several exhibits dedicated to the accomplishments of marginalized groups including female, Latinx, and LGBTQ+ astronomers. Of note is an excellent exhibit that looks at the importance of Islamic astronomers' contributions and how their studies affected the faith and the world. In addition, there are collections of artifacts from astronomers past, including many antique and ancient sundials, as well as telescopes.
